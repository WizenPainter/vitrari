echo "üìã THE PROBLEM:"
echo "---------------"
echo "‚ùå Before the fix:"
echo "   - User logs in successfully and sees cookies in browser"
echo "   - User gets redirected to dashboard ‚úì"
echo "   - But when navigating to /designer or /optimizer..."
echo "   - User gets redirected back to /auth page ‚ùå"
echo "   - Login button shows instead of user name ‚ùå"
echo
echo "üîç ROOT CAUSE:"
echo "   - Auth cookie was only set if 'Remember Me' was checked"
echo "   - Frontend stored token in localStorage"
echo "   - Backend middleware only checked cookies/headers (not localStorage)"
echo "   - Page navigation = regular HTTP requests (no localStorage access)"
echo "   - Result: Middleware couldn't find token ‚Üí redirect to auth"
echo
echo "‚úÖ THE FIX:"
echo "   - Modified auth handler to ALWAYS set cookie on successful login"
echo "   - 'Remember Me' now only affects expiration time, not cookie presence"
echo "   - All page navigation now works seamlessly"
