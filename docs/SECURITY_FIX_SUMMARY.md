# üîê Critical Security Fix: User Data Isolation

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY FIXED**: The Glass Optimizer application was sharing user data across all authenticated users. Any logged-in user could view, edit, and delete projects, designs, and optimizations belonging to other users.

**Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Complete user isolation implemented across all data models.

## Vulnerability Details

### What Was Wrong
- **Projects**: All authenticated users could see ALL projects from ALL users
- **Designs**: All authenticated users could see ALL designs from ALL users  
- **Optimizations**: All authenticated users could see ALL optimizations from ALL users
- **Database**: User data was stored with `user_id` foreign keys but not filtered by them
- **API**: No user context validation in storage layer or handlers

### Security Impact
- **Confidentiality**: ‚ùå Complete breach - business data exposed across user boundaries
- **Integrity**: ‚ùå Users could modify/delete other users' work
- **Availability**: ‚ùå Users could delete others' projects, causing data loss
- **Classification**: **CRITICAL** - Complete multi-tenant data isolation failure

## Fix Implementation

### 1. Database Schema ‚úÖ VERIFIED
The database schema was already correct with proper `user_id` foreign key relationships:

```sql
-- Projects table
CREATE TABLE projects (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,  -- ‚úÖ Already present
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);

-- Designs table  
CREATE TABLE designs (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,  -- ‚úÖ Already present
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);

-- Optimizations table
CREATE TABLE optimizations (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,  -- ‚úÖ Already present
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

### 2. Model Updates ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
Added `UserID` fields to all Go models:

**Updated Models:**
- `models.Project` - Added `UserID int64` field
- `models.Design` - Added `UserID int64` field  
- `models.Optimization` - Added `UserID int64` field

### 3. Storage Interface Changes ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
Updated all storage methods to require `userID` parameter:

**Projects:**
- `GetProjects(userID int64, limit, offset int)` - Now filters by user
- `GetProject(id int, userID int64)` - Now validates ownership
- `UpdateProject(project *models.Project, userID int64)` - Now validates ownership
- `DeleteProject(id int, userID int64)` - Now validates ownership

**Designs:**
- `GetDesigns(userID int64, limit, offset int)` - Now filters by user
- `GetDesign(id int, userID int64)` - Now validates ownership
- `UpdateDesign(design *models.Design, userID int64)` - Now validates ownership
- `DeleteDesign(id int, userID int64)` - Now validates ownership
- `SearchDesigns(query string, userID int64, limit, offset int)` - Now filters by user

**Optimizations:**
- `GetOptimizations(userID int64, limit, offset int)` - Now filters by user
- `GetOptimization(id int, userID int64)` - Now validates ownership
- `UpdateOptimization(opt *models.Optimization, userID int64)` - Now validates ownership
- `DeleteOptimization(id int, userID int64)` - Now validates ownership

### 4. Storage Implementation ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
Updated all SQL queries to include `WHERE user_id = ?` conditions:

**Example - GetProjects() Before:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM projects ORDER BY path LIMIT ? OFFSET ?
```

**Example - GetProjects() After:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM projects WHERE user_id = ? ORDER BY path LIMIT ? OFFSET ?
```

### 5. Service Layer Updates ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
Updated all business logic services to accept and pass through `userID`:

**DesignerService:**
- `CreateDesign(req *models.DesignRequest, userID int64)`
- `GetDesign(id int, userID int64)`
- `GetDesigns(userID int64, limit, offset int)`
- `UpdateDesign(id int, req *models.DesignRequest, userID int64)`
- `DeleteDesign(id int, userID int64)`

**OptimizerService:**
- `RunOptimization(req *models.OptimizationRequest, userID int64)`
- `GetOptimization(id int, userID int64)`
- `GetOptimizations(userID int64, limit, offset int)`

### 6. Handler Updates ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
Updated all HTTP handlers to extract user from request context:

**Pattern Applied to All Handlers:**
```go
func (h *Handler) SomeMethod(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // Extract user from authentication context
    user := services.GetUserFromContext(r.Context())
    if user == nil {
        http.Error(w, "Unauthorized", http.StatusUnauthorized)
        return
    }
    
    // Pass user.ID to service/storage layer
    result, err := h.service.SomeMethod(param, user.ID)
    // ... rest of handler
}
```

### 7. Validation & Security Checks ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
Added comprehensive validation:
- **User Context Validation**: All handlers check for valid user in request context
- **Ownership Validation**: All storage methods validate user owns requested resources
- **Cross-User Access Prevention**: Attempts to access other users' data return 404/403
- **Creation Validation**: New resources automatically set correct `user_id`

## Testing & Verification

### Security Test Suite ‚úÖ CREATED
Created comprehensive test script: `tests/security/test_user_isolation.sh`

**Test Coverage:**
- ‚úÖ User authentication and token generation
- ‚úÖ Project isolation (users only see own projects)
- ‚úÖ Design isolation (users only see own designs)
- ‚úÖ Optimization isolation (users only see own optimizations)
- ‚úÖ Cross-user access prevention (404/403 on unauthorized access)
- ‚úÖ Unauthenticated access protection (401 without valid token)

**How to Run Tests:**
```bash
# Start the server
go run main.go

# Run security tests (in separate terminal)
./tests/security/test_user_isolation.sh
```

## Files Modified

### Core Storage Layer
- `internal/storage/sqlite.go` - Updated all methods with user filtering
- `internal/models/project.go` - Added UserID field
- `internal/models/design.go` - Added UserID field  
- `internal/models/glass.go` - Added UserID field to Optimization model

### Service Layer
- `internal/services/designer.go` - Updated all methods with userID params
- `internal/services/optimizer.go` - Updated all methods with userID params

### Handler Layer
- `internal/handlers/projects.go` - Added user context extraction
- `internal/handlers/designer.go` - Added user context extraction
- `internal/handlers/optimizer.go` - Added user context extraction
- `main.go` - Updated inline handlers with user context

### Test Infrastructure
- `tests/security/test_user_isolation.sh` - New security test suite

## Migration Notes

### Database Migration
No database migration required - the schema already had correct `user_id` foreign keys.

### Existing Data
Existing data will need `user_id` values populated if there's production data.

### Backward Compatibility
This is a breaking change for any API clients, but necessary for security.

## Verification Commands

### 1. Start Server
```bash
cd glass-optimizer
go run main.go
```

### 2. Run Security Tests
```bash
./tests/security/test_user_isolation.sh
```

### 3. Manual Verification
```bash
# Create user 1
curl -X POST http://localhost:9995/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"user1@test.com","password":"pass123","first_name":"User","last_name":"One"}'

# Login user 1
curl -X POST http://localhost:9995/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"user1@test.com","password":"pass123"}'

# Use token to create project (should succeed)
curl -X POST http://localhost:9995/api/projects \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -d '{"name":"My Project","description":"Test"}'

# Try to access without token (should fail with 401)
curl -X GET http://localhost:9995/api/projects
```

## Before vs After

### Before (VULNERABLE)
```sql
-- Users could see ALL projects
SELECT * FROM projects ORDER BY path;

-- Result: Shows projects from ALL users
[{"id":1,"name":"User1 Project"},{"id":2,"name":"User2 Project"},{"id":3,"name":"User3 Project"}]
```

### After (SECURE)
```sql
-- Users only see THEIR projects  
SELECT * FROM projects WHERE user_id = ? ORDER BY path;

-- Result: Shows only current user's projects
[{"id":1,"name":"My Project"}]
```
